To get started, make sure you have create-react-app installed on your machine. If not, install it with ```npm i -g create-react-app``` If you would prefer not to install the package globally, do not prepend 
```create-react-app``` with ```-```g``` and it will instead just install to your current working directory.

Then, ```npx create-react-app your-app-name``` and ```cd``` into the new directory. From here, you can get started.

More dependencies will be added.
